# FlatEase — Smart Apartment Management System

FlatEase is a web-based apartment management system built to replace messy WhatsApp chats, paper logs, and forgotten reminders. It helps apartment managers and tenants handle complaints, payments, leases, and sensitive documents in one secure place.

This project is built as an academic and portfolio-ready application using **Laravel** and **React**, with a strong focus on security, automation, and real-world usability.
